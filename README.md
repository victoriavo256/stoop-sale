My submission to the [CodeDex](https://codedex.io/) 2024 Summer Hackathon! 
(Took place from 7/11/24 12pm EST to 7/12/24 12pm EST.)
Out of 3 available tracks, I chose to do the 2nd one which was a web dev track.
The prompt was to create an interactive invitation website for a stoop sale (similar to a garage or yard sale) being hosted by two friends, Chelsea and Lil, in Brooklyn. Here's the [original prompt post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9LOM5NuACA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==). The requirements were as follows:
⏰ Include a date and time
🌏 Include a place with a map API
🖐 Make it interactive
🔗 Shareability
🌷 Good vibes!



I had a lot of fun brainstorming for this prompt, but it was a very humbling experience trying to turn my ideas into a reality haha. In the end, here's what I was able to build. Hope Chelsea and Lil like it!



FEATURES ⭐

💌 an interactive landing page that makes the website experience feel like opening a personal invitation
🌏 an embedded interactive Google Maps image so you know exactly where to go
🗣 5 social share URLs so you can invite your friends and spread the word about this event
🎶 jazzy bgm from pixabay that sets the mood
💻 some css animations to add extra visual interest, and also bc they're just fun to code
🎨 some fun self-made collages/graphics!

HTML, CSS, Javascript, VSCode (IDE), Vercel (to deploy website), Medibang Paint (to create graphics)



Reflections 💭

There's definitely a few things I wish I could've done better. I had this one idea that I was really attached to, which was to make the box of trinkets near the end of the page interactive so that the user can drag and drop the items to look through the box. It was supposed to mimic the feeling of hunting for cool finds at a stoop sale, and possibly even encourage the user to go in-person and do it for real. but I couldn't figure it out in time. Next time!

In conclusion, this was a really great opportunity for me to learn and grow as a coder. I feel like my problem solving skills improved a lot. Some moments that stood out to me was when I was finally able to get my social sharing URLs working, so now the user can share the event details on Pinterest, Twitter/X, Facebook, E-mail, or via link. Also, I was super excited when I got my website to be mobile and desktop friendly. my website has a simple design that's easy to translate, but I've never looked into responsive designing before so there was definitely a learning curve. overall, as my first hackathon, i had a great experience. 🐸🍊
